# Engagements-Trxs-Calls

The project was to cleverly combine two datasets about doctors, one that tracked sales calls and transactions, and another that tracked engagements with marketing campaigns. The outcome is to identify how effective the marketing campaigns are by seeing if there was a spike in transactions after the engagement, and how sales calls affect the spike.
